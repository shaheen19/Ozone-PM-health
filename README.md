## Ozone and Particulate matter and connection with health
## Goal
The Project was designed to investigate the impact of ozone on the health of individuals.
This project consist of three parts.
1. developing statistical approaches to identify outliers and analomalies.
2. Develop machine learning algorithms to forecast ozone levels.
3. Project how ozone will affect respiratory health in adults and children
## Conclusions 
Due to varied topogrpahy and meterology, it is not possible to combine data for all counties. 
Future project will include analysis for each county.
Identify sources of pollutants in each county and develop algorithms to find major contributors to health.
